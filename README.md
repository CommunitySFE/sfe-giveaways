# SFE Giveaways

This bot basically collects data to see who wins the giveaways on the SFE server. It's pretty cool. Learn more by reading.

## Work in Progress

This bot isn't near finished. Currently, I have it on GitHub so I can manage version control on different devices more efficiently. Contributions are not accepted at this time, but will be once the bot is fully made and released.

## Setup

It's not JavaScript, so don't contribute big changes if you don't know Python (you can make small ones if you know what you're doing). Anyways, here's how you set it up:

**Get requirements:** You can use this to get the required requirements:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt --user # Install locally to user
#
# OR  
#
sudo pip install -r requirements.txt # Install to all users
```

**Database:** You'll need to install MongoDB, the database which we use here. The bot will not function properly without it. Configure it in config/config.json
